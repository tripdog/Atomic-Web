                    <p>A website should be the foundation of any small business' online presence. With more consumers going online to research products and services, your website is often a potential customer's first impression of your business. If you're just getting started with building your own website, you may be overwhelmed with the number of options available for creating a website for your business. Today we're going to focus on WordPress and why it's a great option for small businesses looking to create their own website.</p>
                    <h3>WordPress is perfect for a small business wanting to get their name out there with little maintenance.</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is a great platform for small businesses. It’s easy to use, free and has a massive user base that is constantly being updated. For instance, you can start your website within minutes by choosing a theme among thousands of options that come in different colors and styles. If you want more customization power over your site, WordPress allows users to make changes through plugins or themes that are available on its marketplace..</p>
                    <p>There are other reasons why WordPress is great for small business owners:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You get more control over edits (instead of having to hire someone else)</li>
                        <li>It's easier to find content if you're not tech-savvy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>WordPress has a massive user base.</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world, and its popularity shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it’s estimated that over 60 million people use WordPress today — which accounts for over 25% of all websites online! And those are just desktop users; mobile users are still growing at an astounding rate.</p>

                    <h3>WordPress SEO rocks!</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wordpress SEO is easy to set up and maintain.</li>
                        <li>Wordpress SEO is fairly easy to understand.</li>
                        <li>ordpress SEO is easy to update.</li>
                        <li>If you want to test how well your website does with search engines, Wordpress makes it simple as well!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>WordPress is constantly updated.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>WordPress is updated to fix security issues.</li>
                        <li>WordPress is updated to add new features.</li>
                        <li>WordPress is updated to add support for new devices.</li>
                        <li>Wordpress also gets updates that include more plugins, which help you give your site extra functionality while keeping it secure and stable at the same time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>WordPress is very easy to customize.</h3>
                    <p>The first reason why WordPress is great for small businesses is because it’s incredibly easy to customize. Not only does WordPress have a large community of developers and designers who are constantly creating new plugins, themes and widgets that you can use on your site, but once you get the hang of things, it’s also super easy to make changes yourself with just a few clicks from inside the dashboard.</p>

                    <p>If you don’t know anything about coding or web design and development — no problem! With a little bit of research and effort, you can give yourself complete control over the look and feel of your website without having any knowledge whatsoever about HTML or CSS. And if something breaks along the way (which never happens), there are thousands upon thousands of people online willing to help out with minor tweaks or full-blown redesigns at no cost whatsoever.</p>

                    <h3>Wordpress can grow with your business.</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is a great tool for small businesses looking to grow. Whether you’re just starting out or have been in business for years, chances are that WordPress has something to offer your company. With its robust features and simple set-up, it may be the answer you have been looking for all along! For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>WordPress is an excellent tool for ecommerce websites and blogs alike—and they are often used together, as well. Once you create a website on WordPress and establish your brand presence online, ecommerce becomes easier because customers will already know who you are and what products or services you provide (and maybe even where those products are sold).</li>

                        <li>This means that one site can accommodate both types of content without having multiple sites each with their own URL (e.g., http://www/welovespells/). Just add pages on different topics to build out your content library over time until each page has its own URL pointing back towards this main site's homepage URL instead!"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Wordpress costs less than a hosted site.</h3>
                    <p>Because hosted sites like Wix or SquareSpace use a monthly subscription model, over time, you end up paying much, much more for a web site you never truly own. Let me explain, when somebody builds you a custom WordPress site, you actually own the code and all of the files that make the website. This means you can take that website with you to any other hosting platform out there or have other developers work on it. With a hosted site, you can't take the code or the files anywhere and you pay for the site in perpetuity.</p>

                    <h3>You can make it do just about anything you want.</h3>
                    <p>For example, if your business offers a service that requires the user to be logged in. You can create a login page and add it as one of the pages on your website. WordPress makes it easy for you to add content and functionality without knowing how to write code.</p>

                    <p>WordPress is free and open source, which means that anyone can customize it however they want. If you have an idea for a new feature or plugin but don’t know how to create it yourself, there are many developers who will help out! The WordPress community has built thousands upon thousands of free plugins and themes that make building websites even easier than before – all thanks to the power of crowdsourcing innovation with software like WordPress!</p>

                    <h3>Wordpress is relatively to use, making it great for anyone looking to start a new website right away.</h3>
                    <p>If you’re a small business owner and you want to create a website for your company, WordPress is a great option. It’s free and easy to use, making it perfect for anyone looking to get their name out there as quickly as possible. It also has updated security features that make creating your own site safer than ever before.</p>
                    <p>WordPress was created so that anyone could have their own online presence without needing any special knowledge or training in how to build websites. The code behind this system is constantly being worked on by volunteers all around the world who want to help improve the platform and make it better than ever before. Wordpress has an enormous user base, which means that if you decide on using this CMS (content management system), there will be plenty of people online who can offer assistance when needed!</p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>There are plenty of reasons for small businesses to consider using WordPress. I've listed ten of them here, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to let me know!</p>
